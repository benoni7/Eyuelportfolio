        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            From my early years at Vision Academy High School in Addis Ababa, I’ve always been driven by the desire to create change. As a teenager with a vision for the future, I’ve focused on learning the skills necessary to shape the digital world. My passion for technology, design, and marketing has fueled my journey toward building a career where I can help businesses grow and evolve in an increasingly digital space.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my time at Vision Academy, I started to develop a keen interest in digital technologies. This led me to pursue certifications and hands-on projects that allowed me to transform my passion into practical skills. I earned certifications in <strong>Programming Fundamentals</strong> from <strong>Udacity</strong>, where I gained the foundation to build interactive and responsive websites. I also pursued <strong>Figma Design</strong> at <strong>Alison</strong>, learning how to craft intuitive and visually engaging user interfaces. Additionally, I completed a <strong>Digital Marketing</strong> certification from <strong>UniAthena</strong>, equipping myself with the knowledge to help brands optimize their online presence and drive customer engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve had the opportunity to apply these skills in real-world projects, such as the <strong>BENONI Gym and Fitness Website</strong> and an <strong>E-Commerce Website</strong>, where I focused on both the technical and design aspects, ensuring a seamless user experience. These projects reflect my belief that technology can bring about positive change and create impactful experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a teenager striving for change, I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth. I aim to push the boundaries of what’s possible with every project, and I’m excited to bring innovative ideas to life in the ever-evolving digital landscape.
        </p>
